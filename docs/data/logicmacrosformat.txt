  type can be one of 4 values:

  - Location
  A location macro is a macro for determining whether a player can reach a specific location in the game.
  Locations are divided up by unique entrances that output to the same area that does not have any unique 
  conditions to progress.

  - Entrance
  An entrance macro is a macro for determining where an entrance leads to and if it's accessible.
  Entrances correspond to any point at which a player teleports, such as exiting a house or moving
  between maps (i.e. hyrule field to kokiri forest). It does NOT include dungeon doors as of now.
  The unique attribute is the entrance to which this key outputs to.

  - General
  A general type macro is a macro made up of sub macros, which consist of other general macros or base macros.
  While the goal is to simplify all macros down to base item requirements, general macros are used for frequently 
  used AND/OR logic to make writing and debugging the logic easier. This type of macro does not have any
  unique attribute.

  - Base
  While base is a type of macro, it does not need to be defined. Every type of macro should eventually come down to
  a base macro.

*********************************************************************************************************************

  key is a unique identifier for a macro. The key has different rules it must follow, depending on the type
  of macro:

  - Location
    CanGetTo(location identifier)

  - Entrance
    (starting location identifier)(ending location identifier)

  - General
    (unique identifier)

  - Base
    Start(location identifier) OR Has(item identifier)

*********************************************************************************************************************

  unique attribute is an attribute which changes in definition depending on the type of macro:

  - Location
  Location has the unique attribute of "location" which corresponds to the locations defined on the logic sheet.

  - Entrance
  Entrance has the unique attribue of "entrance" which corresponds to the entrance that is linked to the key entrance.
  This is expected to randomize, which is why it's required.

  General and Base do not have unique identifiers

*********************************************************************************************************************

  requirements are what is needed to complete a given check. locations and entrances tend to require a certain
  area to be accessible while general macros tend to require a specific item.
